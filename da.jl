# Stage 1 — Day-Ahead market (copper-plate economic dispatch)
# ============================================================
# Clears energy for the whole day at once with NO transmission or
# voltage limits (a single system-wide power balance per hour).
# Reservoir hydro is coupled across all 24 hours through the full
# Bellman cost-to-go, exactly as in the multi-network AC build:
# the recentred cuts give reservoir units their opportunity cost so
# the intra-day hydro schedule respects the long-term water value.
#
# Inputs are the per-hour networks already assembled by
# prepare_network (so RES availability, cross-border imports, the
# slack unit and the load-shed units are all included as ordinary
# generators).  Reservoir units must carry zero linear cost in those
# networks (build them with hydro_reservoir_cost = 0.0); their cost
# comes from the θ_future term instead.
#
# Returns the cleared per-unit schedule keyed by hour, which becomes
# the reference the redispatch stage is anchored to:
#     sched :: Dict{Int, Dict{String,Float64}}   hour ⇒ (unit ⇒ MW)
# together with `es_price :: Dict{Int,Float64}` — the marginal price
# (EUR/MWh) of the ES power balance at each hour the gate traded.

# cuts, v_es_0       : Bellman cuts and starting reservoir volume [MWh] for the day
#
# anchor : previous gate's schedule for the TRADABLE hours (net-idx ⇒ unit ⇒ MW).
#          When given, the gate is solved as an *adjustment* market: dispatch cost
#          is minimised first (cheapest units / merit order, exactly as the DA),
#          then — among all cost-optimal solutions — the total movement away from
#          the previous gate is minimised.  This removes the cost-degenerate
#          reshuffles (reservoir water reallocation, LP degeneracy) that otherwise
#          let flexible units drift in opposite directions, while leaving any
#          genuine merit-order change intact.  `nothing` ⇒ plain cost re-clear.
